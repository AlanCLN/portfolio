  "bio": "<p>I am a software engineer with a passion for full-stack web development. I enjoy understanding a stack as a whole and try to break complex topics down into small pieces. Because of this, I've grown to enjoy teaching during my time at the App Academy Bootcamp.</p> <p>Some hobbies include playing basketball, snowboarding, and recently - weightlifting. I also love traveling to new places and explore new things. These past couple of years have definitely been rough but hopefully I can start writing off my bucket list again.</p>",
